phpcoin
=======

PHP Crypto Coin library for working with Bitcoin, Litecoin and other Bitcoin compatible
crypto currencies.

This library will implement all the funtions needed to work with crypto coins natively in
PHP. This will mean a native implementation for most of the functionality of Bitcoin and
other crypto coins.

PLEASE NOTE
===========

This library is still in development and is NOT ready for any kind of use!!!

At the moment this should be viewed more as a study project for the developer to get to
know Bitcoin. Stay away!
